## Problem 1

``` r
data("early_january_weather") #load data
```

This dataset include the following variables: origin, year, month, day,
hour, temp, dewp, humid, wind_dir, wind_speed, wind_gust, precip,
pressure, visib, time_hour.

One of the important variables is ‘temp’, which records the temperature
at the time of record.

Another important variable is ‘time_hour’, which records the time that
the weather information are measured and recorded.

The dataset include 358 rows and 15 columns.

The mean temperature among the collected data is 39.5821229.

The code chunk below creates a scatterplot on temperature vs. time in
hour. The humidity can be identified through the color of the points.
The plot is saved to the project directory.

``` r
# create and print scatterplot
temp_time_plot = ggplot(
  early_january_weather, 
  aes(x = time_hour, y = temp, color = humid)
  ) + 
  geom_point() +
  labs(
  title = "Early January Temperature vs. Time with Humidity", 
  x = "Time (hour)", 
  y = "Temperature"
  )

print(temp_time_plot)
```

``` r
# save plot to directory
ggsave(filename = "temp_time_scatterplot.png", plot = temp_time_plot)
```

## Problem 2

``` r
# Create Variables
rand_num = rnorm(10)

logical = rand_num > 0

rand_char = c("a", "b", "c", "d", "e", "f", "g", "h", "i","j")

factor_vec <- factor(rep(c("A", "B", "C"), length.out = 10),
                   levels = c("A", "B", "C"))
```

``` r
# Combine into Data Frame
p2_df = data.frame(
  random_sample = rand_num, 
  sample_gt_zero = logical, 
  character_vector = rand_char, 
  factor_ABC = factor_vec
)
```

``` r
# pull variables and calculate mean
rand_num_mean = mean(pull(p2_df, var = random_sample))

logical_mean = mean(pull(p2_df, var = sample_gt_zero))

char_mean = mean(pull(p2_df, var = character_vector))
```

    ## Warning in mean.default(pull(p2_df, var = character_vector)): argument is not
    ## numeric or logical: returning NA

``` r
factor_mean = mean(pull(p2_df, var = factor_ABC))
```

    ## Warning in mean.default(pull(p2_df, var = factor_ABC)): argument is not numeric
    ## or logical: returning NA

Mean of the random sample from standard normal distribution is
-0.4309894.

Mean of the logical vector indicating whether elements of the sample are
greater than zero is 0.3.

Mean of the character vector is NA.

Mean of the factor vector with 3 levels is NA.

The means of random sample from standard normal distribution and the
logical vector works.

The means of the character vectors and factor vectors do not work.

The code chunk below try converting logical, character, and factor
variables with as.numeric.

``` r
# convert logical, character, and factor variables with as.numeric
num_log = as.numeric(p2_df$sample_gt_zero)

num_char = as.numeric(p2_df$character_vector)
```

    ## Warning: NAs introduced by coercion

``` r
num_fac = as.numeric(p2_df$factor_ABC)
```

When the logical variable is converted, TRUE is convereted into 1 and
FALSE is converted into 0.

There’s a warning message when converting character variable: “Warning
message: NAs introduced by coercion” All outcomes are “NA”.

When factor variable is converted, levels “A”, “B”, and “C” are
converted into number 1, 2, and 3 respectively.

as.numeric() tries to convert non-numeric variables into numeric. For
logical variables, 0 and 1 con represent TRUE/FALSE. For factor
variable, the order of levels are demonstrated.

When trying to mean of logical variable, the mean of as.numeric result
is taken. For the mean of factor variable, it is not automatically
converted with as.numeric. Thus the mean cannot be calculated.

There is no way to convert character variable into numeric values. Thus,
it’s unable to take the mean.
